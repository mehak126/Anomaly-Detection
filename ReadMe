The project consists of 4 files. 
1 client file and 3 gen files.
The client is the node that is receiving the information from the other 3 nodes which are generating them.
This is made to replicate a central node which processes data received from sensors.
Initially generated data points are received and clusters are formed by the client node.
This imitates normal conditions for several days sensed by the above sensors.
Finally, new points are added to be assessed by the client, and are classified as normal/anomalous.

Kindly change the IPs of the nodes as required when trying to run the code. These IPs can be found in lines 48-58 in the client.py file.

The 4 files can be run from a single system as well. If not using raspberry pi's kindly comment out lines 7, 245-251, 257-258, 305-306 in the client.py file.
